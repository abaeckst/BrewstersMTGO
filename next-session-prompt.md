# Next Session Starter: iOS Mobile Debugging

## Quick Context
The Brewster's MTGO Mission Terminal spy-thriller web app is fully functional on desktop but **still not working on iPhone devices** despite extensive mobile compatibility work in the previous session.

## Current Status
- ✅ **Desktop**: Fully functional at https://abaeckst.github.io/BrewstersMTGO
- ❌ **iPhone**: Not loading/functioning on actual iOS devices
- ✅ **Compatibility Layer**: Extensive iOS fixes implemented but not verified

## What Was Already Done (Previous Session)
1. **Touch Event Fixes**: Fixed passive listener conflicts, added comprehensive touch handlers
2. **iOS Audio Context**: Added unlockAudioContext() method and iOS-specific initialization  
3. **Safe Area Support**: iPhone notch and home indicator compatibility
4. **Form Input Fixes**: Prevented iOS zoom, webkit appearance fixes
5. **iOS Polyfills**: Comprehensive iOS detection and compatibility layer
6. **Desktop Restoration**: Fixed desktop regression caused by mobile fixes

## Files to Review
- `/docs/mobile-compatibility-work-log.md` - Complete work log
- `/ios-testing-checklist.md` - Comprehensive testing checklist
- `/js/ios-polyfills.js` - iOS compatibility layer
- `/css/utilities/ios-mobile.css` - iOS-specific styles

## Immediate Next Steps
Your primary task is to **debug why the app is still not working on actual iPhone devices**. Here's the recommended approach:

### 1. **Enable Safari Remote Debugging** (CRITICAL)
```
iPhone: Settings → Safari → Advanced → Web Inspector: ON
Mac: Safari → Develop → [iPhone] → [Page Name]
```
This will show actual JavaScript errors and loading issues on the iPhone.

### 2. **Check for Fundamental Issues**
- ES6 module loading failures on iOS Safari
- CORS/security restrictions with local server
- JavaScript errors preventing app initialization
- Network connectivity issues

### 3. **Create Minimal Test**
If the full app doesn't work, create a minimal test page to isolate the issue:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>iOS Test</h1>
    <button onclick="alert('Touch works!')">Test Touch</button>
    <script>console.log('JavaScript loaded');</script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 4. **Try HTTPS**
Some iOS features require HTTPS. Try:
```bash
npx ngrok http 8000
# Use the https:// URL on iPhone
```

### 5. **Check iOS Version Compatibility**
- Verify iOS Safari version supports ES6 modules
- Check if babel transpilation is needed
- Test on different iOS versions if possible

## Session Goal
**Identify and fix the root cause preventing the app from working on iPhone devices.** The extensive compatibility work is done - now we need to debug the actual deployment/loading issues.

## Use This Prompt
"I need to debug why Brewster's MTGO Mission Terminal isn't working on iPhone devices. The app works perfectly on desktop, and I've implemented extensive iOS compatibility fixes, but it's still not functional on actual iPhones. I need you to help me set up Safari remote debugging and identify the root cause of the iOS loading/functionality issues. Start by reviewing the mobile compatibility work log in `/docs/mobile-compatibility-work-log.md` and then guide me through debugging the actual iPhone problems."
