- [ ] No double-tap zoom on buttons
- [ ] Smooth transitions between screens
- [ ] Signal bars animation works
- [ ] Personal message displays correctly

#### Briefing Screen Tests
- [ ] Accept/Decline buttons work with touch
- [ ] Audio feedback on touch interactions
- [ ] Visual feedback for selected option
- [ ] Smooth transition to countdown

#### Audio System Tests
- [ ] First touch unlocks audio context
- [ ] All sounds play without errors
- [ ] Mission Impossible theme plays during countdown
- [ ] No audio delay or sync issues
- [ ] Volume controls work properly

#### Form Input Tests (Auth Screen)
- [ ] Agent name input doesn't trigger iOS zoom
- [ ] Access code input doesn't trigger iOS zoom
- [ ] Inputs respond to touch focus
- [ ] Keyboard appears/disappears smoothly
- [ ] Input values submit correctly
- [ ] No iOS styling conflicts

#### Layout Tests
- [ ] Safe areas respected on iPhone with notch
- [ ] Content doesn't hide behind iOS bars
- [ ] Landscape orientation works
- [ ] Portrait orientation works
- [ ] Scrolling works smoothly (no rubber-band)
- [ ] Screen transitions are smooth

#### Performance Tests
- [ ] App loads quickly on iOS Safari
- [ ] Animations run at 60fps
- [ ] No memory leaks during transitions
- [ ] Battery usage reasonable
- [ ] No iOS thermal throttling

### Regression Testing
Ensure desktop functionality still works:
- [ ] Mouse interactions work on desktop
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Audio system works on desktop
- [ ] All screen transitions work
- [ ] Performance maintained

### iOS-Specific Edge Cases
- [ ] App works when added to home screen (PWA mode)
- [ ] Works with iOS reduced motion settings
- [ ] Works with iOS dark mode
- [ ] Works with iOS text size adjustments
- [ ] Handles iOS call interruptions
- [ ] Handles iOS background/foreground transitions

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Audio fails gracefully if blocked
- [ ] Touch events work even with gloves (capacitive)
- [ ] Works with external keyboards/mice connected
- [ ] Handles network connectivity issues
- [ ] Graceful degradation with JavaScript disabled

## Common iOS Issues to Watch For

1. **White flash on transitions** - Check for proper background colors
2. **Audio not playing** - Verify audio context unlock happens
3. **Buttons not responding** - Check touch event handlers
4. **Zooming on input focus** - Verify font-size >= 16px
5. **Layout jumps** - Check safe area implementation
6. **Double-firing events** - Verify event handler setup
7. **Scrolling issues** - Check overflow and touch properties
8. **Performance drops** - Monitor frame rates and memory

## Debug Information

### Console Logs to Monitor
- `ðŸ”“ Audio context unlocked`
- `ðŸ“± iOS detected, applying compatibility fixes`
- `ðŸ’¤ Wake interaction detected`
- `ðŸŽ¯ Mission choice: ACCEPTED/DECLINED`
- Audio playback success/failure messages

### Browser DevTools Checks
- Network tab: Verify all assets load
- Console: No JavaScript errors
- Performance: Check frame rate during animations
- Application: Check local storage persistence

## Success Criteria

The app is considered iOS-ready when:
- âœ… All touch interactions work smoothly
- âœ… Audio plays reliably after first interaction  
- âœ… No layout issues on any supported iOS device
- âœ… Performance matches desktop experience
- âœ… All user flows complete successfully
- âœ… No iOS-specific bugs or glitches
