# BREWSTER'S MTGO MISSION TERMINAL - ACTIVE PLAN

## Current Status
- **Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Architecture
- **Subphase:** 1.2 - Core Systems (Completed 1.1)
- **Date:** 2025-07-04
- **Session:** Foundation Complete

## Next Session Objectives - UPDATED BASED ON GAP ANALYSIS
1. **CRITICAL:** Implement HUD targeting lines (SVG animations connecting buttons to descriptions)
2. **CRITICAL:** Add mission screen alert messages ("AWAITING RESPONSE", "CHOOSE NOW - TRANSMISSION UNSTABLE")
3. **CRITICAL:** Complete timer glitch sequence ("Your time starts N" → "NOW" with dramatic effects)
4. **HIGH:** Enhance terminal header with ASCII borders and "SECURE CHANNEL" styling
5. **HIGH:** Add button materialization animations (spin-in with scale effects)
6. **MEDIUM:** Create placeholder audio files for testing
7. **MEDIUM:** Implement mission briefing wipe transition

## Open Questions - UPDATED
- [ ] Exact access code format and validation rules?
- [ ] Audio file formats (MP3 vs WebM for compatibility)?
- [ ] Real contributor list and their associated Magic cards for credits?
- [ ] Mission statistics data (real vs placeholder)?
- [ ] Access to actual 8-bit Mission Impossible theme files?

## CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED
Based on conversation review, we're missing several core elements:
- **HUD targeting lines** - Essential visual connection between buttons and descriptions
- **Timer glitch sequence** - The dramatic "N→O→T→YET→NOW" text transformation with effects
- **Mission screen urgency** - Flashing alerts and dramatic styling
- **Audio integration** - 8-bit Mission Impossible theme for sound test and timer
- **Credits sequence** - Statistics display and contributor scroll

## Technical Decisions Pending
- [ ] Audio format selection (MP3 vs WebM for compatibility)
- [ ] State persistence method (localStorage vs sessionStorage)
- [ ] Animation library vs pure CSS animations
- [ ] Mobile audio unlock strategy
- [ ] Loading/preloading strategy for assets

## Architecture Notes
- Multi-file approach for maintainability
- Modular JavaScript with ES6 modules
- CSS split by concern (main, animations, mobile)
- State machine pattern for sequence control
- Event-driven audio system

## Risk Factors
- Mobile audio autoplay restrictions
- Large audio file sizes affecting load time
- Complex animation performance on older devices
- Synchronization between audio and visuals
- QR code scanning environment variables

## Success Criteria for Phase 1
- [x] Clean file structure established
- [x] Documentation system in place
- [x] Basic HTML/CSS/JS foundation working
- [x] Audio system architecture defined
- [x] State management pattern implemented
- [x] Agent onboarding flow sketched out

## Progress Summary
Phase 1, Subphase 1.1 is complete. We have:
- Full HTML structure for all screens
- Modular CSS architecture with animations
- Complete JavaScript module system
- State machine controlling app flow
- Audio engine ready for sound integration
- All major UI components in place

## Notes for Next Session
- Focus on agent onboarding experience first
- Create minimal viable audio system
- Test on mobile device early
- Keep performance metrics in mind
- Document all design decisions
