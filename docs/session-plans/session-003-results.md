## Key Integration Points Established

### 1. Audio-State Machine Pattern
```javascript
// Automatic audio cues for state transitions
AudioEngine.playStateTransition(oldState, newState);
AudioEngine.playContextualAudio(newState);
```

### 2. Mission Screen Initialization Pattern
```javascript
// Cinematic engine integration
if (screenName === 'mission') {
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.missionScreen.init();
    }, revealElements.length * 300 + 500);
}
```

### 3. Progressive Audio Integration
```javascript
// Stage-based audio during mission sequence
AudioEngine.play('connectionEstablish');  // Signal detection
AudioEngine.play('terminalTextBeep');     // Typing feedback
AudioEngine.play('beep');                 // Button interactions
```

## Mission Screen Features

### Signal Detection Stage
