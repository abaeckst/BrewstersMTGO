### Session #005: Mobile Reset & UI Fixes - 2025-07-05
**Phase:** V1 Quality Improvements  
**Duration:** Complete  
**Status:** ✅ Mobile reset and UI fixes implemented

#### Objectives - COMPLETED
- [x] Add mobile-friendly reset functionality
- [x] Fix mission screen yellow text display
- [x] Improve cross-device reset accessibility
- [x] Debug CSS specificity issues

#### Completed Features
1. **Mobile Reset Functionality**: Added 5-tap corner sequence for localStorage reset
   - **Desktop**: Ctrl+Shift+R (unchanged)
   - **Mobile**: 5 rapid taps in bottom-right corner within 2 seconds
   - **Shared Logic**: Extracted `performReset()` function for consistency
   - **Feedback**: Console logging and visual flash on reset activation

2. **Mission Screen UI Fixes**: Fixed yellow text display issue
   - **Removed**: "CHOOSE TO ACCEPT OR DECLINE THIS MISSION" text and spacing
   - **Enhanced**: "TAP YOUR SELECTION" text now displays in yellow (#ffff00)
   - **CSS Fix**: Added high-specificity rule `.touch-hint.yellow-text` to override inheritance
   - **Root Cause**: CSS specificity conflict with existing `.touch-hint` animation

#### Technical Details
- **Mobile Reset**: Located in `/js/app.js` lines 393-434
- **Touch Detection**: Uses `touchstart` event with bottom-right corner coordinates
- **Reset Logic**: Clears localStorage and provides visual feedback before reload
- **CSS Specificity**: Fixed yellow text with `.touch-hint.yellow-text` selector
- **Color System**: Uses `--color-secondary: #ffff00` for yellow text with glow effect

#### Files Modified
- `/js/app.js`: Added mobile reset functionality 
- `/index.html`: Removed prompt text, added `yellow-text` class
- `/css/main.css`: Added high-specificity yellow text override

### Session #010: UI Feedback Issues Investigation - 2025-07-06
**Phase:** Bug Resolution & Polish
**Duration:** In Progress
**Status:** ⚠️ Issues persist - requires deeper investigation

#### Issues Addressed (Attempted)
1. **Retirement Bonus Text Special Treatment Removal**
   - ✅ Successfully removed golden glow animation and celebration sequence
   - ✅ MTGO tickets now display as normal text
   
2. **Honorable Discharge Header Size**
   - ❌ Multiple attempts made but text still notably smaller than "MISSION DECLINED" title
   - ❌ CSS changes to `text-3xl` not having expected visual impact
   
3. **Briefing Screen Decline Button**
   - ✅ Successfully changed to refresh page instead of transitioning to declined screen
   
4. **Scroll Reset Issues**
   - ❌ Multiple investigation attempts failed to resolve core issue
   - ❌ Console shows successful scroll reset but visual behavior unchanged
   - ❌ Both mission accept/decline and auth→mission transitions still scroll incorrectly

#### Technical Analysis Attempted
- **Root Cause Theory**: Cinematic transition system `smoothScrollTo()` overriding scroll resets
- **Architecture Conflict**: Session #008 absolute positioning potentially interfering
- **Fix Attempts**: Modified cinematic transition, removed redundant calls, timing adjustments
- **Result**: All attempted fixes failed to resolve actual user experience

#### Lessons Learned
- **Investigation Approach**: Need more patience and thorough investigation before implementing
- **Testing Verification**: Changes that appear correct in code don't match user experience
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Multiple layers of complexity require systematic isolation testing
- **Architecture Understanding**: Deeper understanding of CSS cascade and transition timing needed

#### Files Modified (Session #010)
- `js/declined-screen.js` - Removed celebration code
- `css/main-phase2.css` - Badge text size changes  
- `js/briefing-screen.js` - Decline button refresh fix
- `js/cinematic.js` - Transition system modifications (ineffective)
- `js/mission-screen.js` - Scroll reset timing changes (ineffective)

#### Next Session Requirements
- **Systematic Investigation**: Test each component in isolation
- **CSS Debugging**: Verify actual computed styles vs expected styles
- **Scroll Behavior Analysis**: Complete understanding of scroll position management
- **Potential Refactoring**: May require architectural changes if current approach is fundamentally flawed
