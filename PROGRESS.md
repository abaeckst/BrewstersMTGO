## üîß Operative Name Storage System Fix (2025-07-06)

### ‚úÖ **Bug Fix Session**: Operative Name Consistency (COMPLETED)
**Problem Identified:** Inconsistent operative name behavior across screens due to:
- Dual storage system (localStorage + sessionStorage) causing conflicts
- Mission screen timing issue (constructor vs init() method)
- Incomplete cleanup during app reset and restart scenarios
- Browser form persistence interfering with fresh sessions

### ‚úÖ **Minimal Fix Implementation** (COMPLETED)
**Strategy:** Conservative approach preserving all existing architecture
**Risk Level:** Very low - no breaking changes or architectural modifications

#### **Changes Made:**
1. **Fixed Dual Storage Conflict**
   - Removed sessionStorage usage from `cinematic.js:685`
   - Standardized on localStorage-only approach
   - Ensured consistent retrieval across all screens

2. **Enhanced App Reset Cleanup**
   - Added `agentName` clearing to `app.js` resetApplicationState function
   - Prevents old names from persisting between sessions
   - Comprehensive storage cleanup on app initialization

3. **Fixed Mission Screen Timing Issue**
   - Moved agent name retrieval from constructor to `init()` method in `mission-screen.js`
   - Personal message now generated when screen is actually shown (not when class is instantiated)
   - Consistent with how other screens handle agent name operations

4. **Added Defensive Form Clearing**
   - Clear auth form values on app startup to prevent browser auto-fill persistence
   - Programmatic reset of input fields in `resetApplicationState()`
   - Eliminates browser form memory interfering with fresh sessions

#### **Files Modified:**
- `js/cinematic.js` - Removed sessionStorage usage
- `js/app.js` - Enhanced reset cleanup + defensive form clearing
- `js/mission-screen.js` - Fixed timing of agent name retrieval

#### **Testing Verified:**
- ‚úÖ Operative name displays correctly in mission personal message
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across all screens (briefing, credits, declined)
- ‚úÖ Proper cleanup on app reset and restart scenarios
- ‚úÖ No browser form persistence issues
- ‚úÖ Zero regression in existing functionality

### **Operative Name Storage Architecture (Post-Fix)**
- **Single Storage Method**: localStorage only for persistent operative name
- **Consistent Timing**: All screens retrieve agent name in `init()` methods when shown
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: App reset, restart functions, and startup clear all storage
- **Defensive Measures**: Form clearing prevents browser interference
- **Validation**: Fallback to appropriate defaults when no name stored

**Fix Status:** Operative name storage system now behaves consistently across all screens and scenarios with zero architectural impact.

**Final Status:** V2 architecture rebuild + CSS refactoring + operative name storage fix successfully completed with all core requirements met, modular CSS architecture implemented, and robust storage system operational.
