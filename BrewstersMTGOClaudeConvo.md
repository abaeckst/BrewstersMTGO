Can you give me a simple web app that shows a big red lit-up button. When the user clicks on it, it does a simple button press animation. a green text message appears on the screen that mimics an 80 computer terminal style and it types out in computer program syntax style "val(funds=mtgotickets) deposited in #mtgoaccount:goblinsurprise" and elipses like it's in progress and then Deposit Successful!

or there's a smaller button in the bottom right of the screen that says "Disable App". When you click that button, the app goes black and a red "app disabled" message flashes on the screen. then it stops and holds the message on screen.

can you ask me some clarifying questions before you build a prototype. Do you get the vibe i'm going for? like old-school spy kinda shit. big stakes feel

Strategized web app design with spy-terminal aesthetic and interactions

I absolutely get the vibe you're going for! That retro spy thriller, high-stakes computer terminal aesthetic is really cool. I can picture the green monospace text typing out character by character with that authentic 80s feel.

A few clarifying questions to nail the execution:

1. **Terminal styling**: Are you thinking classic green-on-black CRT monitor look with maybe a subtle scanline effect? Or more of a dark theme with bright green text?
2. **Button press animation**: Should the big red button have like a satisfying "thunk" visual - maybe it depresses/scales down and glows brighter when pressed?
3. **Typing speed**: For the terminal text effect, do you want it to type out fairly quickly (like someone typing fast) or slower for dramatic effect?
4. **Flashing "app disabled"**: Should this be like an urgent alert-style flash (rapid on/off) or more of a slow, ominous pulse?
5. **Sound effects**: I can't add actual audio, but should I include visual cues that suggest there would be sound (like button highlighting on press, screen flash effects)?
6. **Overall color scheme**: Sticking with classic green terminal text, red buttons, black background? Or any other accent colors for that authentic retro-tech feel?

The whole "goblinsurprise" account name adds a nice touch of personality to the spy aesthetic! I'm excited to build this - it sounds like it'll have that perfect blend of serious computer terminal vibes with a fun edge.

1. classic green on black CRT monitor
2. button press animation sounds awesome
3. slower for dramatic effect
4. slow ominous pulse
5. yeah sure
6. yeah stick with that

Perfect! I love the classic spy terminal aesthetic you're going for. Let me build this retro terminal app with all those dramatic effects.

Crafted retro spy terminal with dramatic CRT effects

There you go! This has all that classic 80s spy terminal aesthetic you're looking for:

- **Big red glowing button** that does a satisfying press animation with scale and glow effects
- **Slow dramatic typing** of your terminal message with authentic cursor and progress dots
- **Classic green-on-black CRT monitor** look with subtle scanlines and screen flicker
- **Ominous pulsing red "APP DISABLED"** message when you hit that bottom-right disable button
- **Retro terminal vibes** with the "SECURE TERMINAL" header and monospace font

The whole thing has that perfect blend of serious spy computer terminal meets slightly playful "goblinsurprise" account name. The typing speed is nice and slow for maximum dramatic effect, and the button press feels really satisfying with the visual feedback.

Try clicking the big red button to see the full sequence play out, then hit "DISABLE APP" to see the ominous shutdown effect. Very cool retro spy aesthetic!

the button is covering the text after you hit initiate transfer, figure out a way to make that not the case.
 and can you make the red button feel more 3d. 
and can you make the disable app button bigger

Engineered 3D button and layout improvements for better UX.

7s

Perfect! I've fixed all those issues:

**Fixed the text overlap**: The button now has proper spacing and the terminal output flows naturally below it instead of being positioned absolutely. No more text getting covered!

**Made the red button way more 3D**:

- Added a radial gradient with realistic lighting effects
- Multiple layered shadows for depth (outer shadow, glow, inset highlights and shadows)
- Button now "lifts" slightly on hover and "presses down" when clicked
- Much more realistic physical button feel

**Made the disable button bigger**:

- Increased padding and font size significantly
- Added bold font weight and enhanced glow effects
- Now much more prominent and easier to click

The button should now feel like a real physical button you'd slam in a tense spy movie scene, and the terminal text will appear clearly below it without any overlap issues!

Can you make it so there are two buttons, one red and blue. both like the current initiate transfer button.

can you make one button say Deny Mission
and under it in computer terminal text say Receive: $600 Mission

can you make the other say Accept Mission
and under it in computer terminal text say Receive: Operation Brewster's Modo

when you choose deny mission same terminal style print out, but make the computer syntax more program looking and feel more dramatic

when you choose accept mission

Present the mission

your mission: give away 200 mtgo tickets in a contest. you must run the contest with integrity, fairness, and openness to the public. 
your materials: access to the goblinsurprise account loaded with 200 tickets. 
a goblin surprise x account. (insert link to account here)
your reward: 600 mtgo tickets.

present it in a cool spy movie esque way the look and feel of the css for this delivery. thinking mission impossible.

can you ask me a few clarifying questions before you build this version

Strategized spy-themed interface design with mission buttons

4s

Oh this is getting even cooler! I love the spy mission briefing concept with the choice between accepting and denying. Very Mission Impossible vibes.

A few questions to nail the execution:

1. **Button layout**: Should the two buttons be side-by-side horizontally, or stacked vertically? And should they be the same size as the current button or maybe slightly smaller to fit both?
2. **Color scheme**: You mentioned red and blue - should the "Deny Mission" be red (danger/abort) and "Accept Mission" be blue (go/proceed)? Or the reverse?
3. **Mission briefing presentation**: When they accept, should the mission details appear in the same terminal typing style, or more like a formal briefing document that slides in/fades in? Thinking like those classic spy movie briefing screens.
4. **Deny mission output**: For the dramatic computer syntax when denying, are you thinking like system shutdown sequences, or more like "MISSION ABORTED" with error codes and technical gibberish?
5. **The link**: For the "goblin surprise x account" - should I put a placeholder link, or do you have a specific URL you want included?
6. **Disable button**: Should that stay in the same spot, or move it since we're adding more elements?
7. **Mission briefing style**: Should it feel more like a dossier/file (with headers, sections, etc.) or more like streaming terminal commands? I'm picturing something that feels very official and high-stakes.

The whole MTGO ticket contest mission is a great touch - very creative way to gamify what could be a regular giveaway!

A

1. slighty larger even. and side by side horizontal
2. sure
3. yeah, you got the vibe
4. yeah you can do that in addition to the depositing of funds display
5. placeholder link is fine
6. that button is going away
7. dossier file

Engineered dramatic mission interface with two-button interaction design

Perfect! I'm totally picturing this now - two big dramatic buttons with that classic "accept/deny the mission" spy movie tension. The dossier-style briefing will be perfect for that Mission Impossible classified document feel.

Let me build this expanded version with the dual mission choice system:

Retro Spy Terminal App

Interactive artifact ∙ Version 8 

Engineered dramatic mission interface with classified briefing aesthetic

10s

Boom! This is so much cooler now - you've got that perfect Mission Impossible spy briefing vibe going on!

**What's new:**

- **Two chunky 3D buttons** side by side - red "DENY MISSION" and blue "ACCEPT MISSION"
- **Dramatic choice descriptions** underneath each button
- **Epic deny sequence** with abort protocols, system warnings, and the $600 deposit with hardcore terminal syntax
- **Accept sequence** that leads to a full **classified mission briefing dossier**
- **Mission briefing** styled like a real classified document with sections, stamps, and that "self-destruct in 30 seconds" message

The whole **Operation Brewster's Modo** briefing has that perfect spy movie feel - complete with classified stamps, color-coded sections, and all the mission details laid out like a real intelligence operation. The MTGO ticket contest becomes this epic secret mission!

The deny sequence is properly dramatic with all the abort protocols and technical syntax, while the accept sequence builds tension before revealing the full classified briefing.

Try both buttons - the whole experience feels like you're making a real high-stakes decision in a spy thriller! The Mission Impossible vibes are definitely strong with this one.

Incoming Transmision at the top is not quite clear enough. there needs to be more styling and presentation to sell the conceit. suggest a few options for how to achieve this
the receive messages are good, but they aren't clearly connected enough visually to their button. suggest a few options for how to achieve this
there needs to be some more active call to action. 
i like how the deny mission thing displays out. can you make the opening page present and reveal itself out like that. do something with some sizzle for the buttons animating in.
and can you have the mission brieing animate in and appear with a smoother transition to that new layout. and can you have the mission briefing read in.
when we get to the social media credentials, can you have credentials being delivered to him in a way that makes it seem like the system is communicating to him slowly. then it will trigger a social media message being sent to him. but for now it'll be placeholder.
the last thing the mission should print out is you have Two weeks.
then a timer appears that is like an analog countdown timer. with a box for days hours minutes seconds. there's a clear sub-box for each of those. the whole thing is stylized like old analog tech. there's a nice flipping over animation when the timer starts working, but it's not moving yet. it's at 07 00 00 00. the headers on top are abbreviated and part of the old stylized tech.
then it says your time starts. and it's very dramatic and slow as the letters N and O digitally reassemble. Then it looks like a W is being reassamebled but it becomes a T.
Then a YET quickly appears
Then we got some ellipsis. then it says your time starts now. and the timer starts ticking down at the normal rate with the animation style i described.

Crafted cinematic, multi-layered interface design with dramatic reveal.

This is getting SO cinematic! I love where this is headed - full Mission Impossible vibes with all that dramatic tension building. Let me break down some options for each element:

**"Incoming Transmission" styling options:**

1. **Signal interference effect** - glitchy text that stabilizes with scan lines and static
2. **Classified header treatment** - red warning borders, pulsing alert lights, "SECURE CHANNEL" indicators
3. **Retro computer terminal** - ASCII art border, signal strength bars, transmission status readouts
4. **Dramatic typing reveal** - letter-by-letter with interference sounds (visual cues)

**Button-description connection options:**

1. **HUD targeting lines** - thin green lines that draw from button to description with crosshair effects
2. **Matching glow halos** - descriptions sit inside the button's glow field with same color
3. **Speech bubble callouts** - sleek terminal-style info boxes with connecting arrows
4. **Integrated overlay** - descriptions appear as holographic overlays on the buttons themselves

**Call to action urgency:**

1. **Flashing "AWAITING RESPONSE"** prompt with countdown pressure
2. **Pulsing alert borders** around the whole choice area
3. **"CHOOSE NOW - TRANSMISSION UNSTABLE"** warning text
4. **Blinking cursor** with "DECISION REQUIRED" status

**Opening reveal sequence:**

- Terminal boot-up with system diagnostics
- Buttons materializing with particle effects
- Scan lines revealing each element
- "SIGNAL ACQUIRED" → "DECRYPTING" → "READY"

**Mission briefing smooth transition:**

- Slide down from top like a classified folder dropping
- Fade in sections one by one as they "type in"
- Glitch transition between interfaces

**Timer questions:**

- Should it actually count down in real time or just be visual?
- The "N-O → T, YET" sequence sounds amazing - do you want glitch/reassembly effects?

Which of these directions feels right for the vibe you're going for? I can focus on the ones that hit best!

A

transmision styling options: i like retro computer terminal

button description connection options. i like hud targeting lines

call to action urgency: i like 1 combined with 3

Opening reveal sequence: terminal boot-up with system diagnostics

mission briefing: do some cool wipe sequence like an old school terminal would

timer: just be visual
yeah i want glitch reassembly effects

Holy cow, this is absolutely EPIC! 🎬 This is like a full Mission Impossible experience now:

**What's new and cinematic:**

- **Terminal boot sequence** that runs on page load with authentic system diagnostics
- **"Incoming Transmission" header** with retro computer terminal styling, scan lines, and "SECURE CHANNEL" indicators
- **HUD targeting lines** that draw from buttons to descriptions with perfect timing
- **Flashing urgent alerts** - "AWAITING RESPONSE" + "CHOOSE NOW - TRANSMISSION UNSTABLE"
- **Epic button materialization** - they spin in with scale effects and perfect timing
- **Mission briefing wipe transition** - slides down like a classified folder dropping
- **Section-by-section briefing reveal** - each part fades in dramatically
- **Credentials delivery sequence** - types out with system accessing effects
- **Analog countdown timer** - old-school tech styling with flip animations
- **The glitch sequence** - "N→O→T, YET..." with perfect dramatic timing and reassembly effects

The whole experience is now a complete spy thriller! The boot sequence sells the authentic terminal feel, the HUD lines make it feel like military tech, and that glitch sequence at the end is pure cinematic gold.

Try refreshing the page to see the full boot sequence, then hit "ACCEPT MISSION" to experience the entire briefing flow with the timer and glitch effects. This feels like something straight out of a blockbuster spy movie! 🕵️‍♂️

can you create a specification doc that purely focuses on how to build everything we talked about.

what i want you to do is lay out something that will help claude code build this project. i want you to focus on helping claude code approach this problem from a multi-stage angle where it wears many hats and analyzes and plans this from different angles with great consideration given.

i want you to focus on allowing claude code to determine an execution path on accomplishing building something that meets our spec.

the goal is an output i can give to claude code that will help it initialize the project that's end result is producing a website that goes to https://abaeckst.github.io/BrewstersMTGO as we're going to real life link to that site on a QR code when we present this project

i need a cd to naviate to C:\Users\abaec\Development\brewstersmtgo in ubuntu wsl for claude code

Mapped WSL path for navigating Windows development directory.

2s

Here's the cd command to navigate to that Windows directory from Ubuntu WSL:

bash

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/abaec/Development/brewstersmtgo
```

In WSL, Windows drives are mounted under `/mnt/` so:

- `C:\` becomes `/mnt/c/`
- Windows backslashes `\` become forward slashes `/`
- The rest of the path stays the same

If the directory doesn't exist yet, you can create it first:

bash

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/c/Users/abaec/Development/brewstersmtgo
cd /mnt/c/Users/abaec/Development/brewstersmtgo
```
